          Hi, I&apos;m Sergio. I&apos;m a former academic researcher now
          transitioning into tech. I discovered coding through automating
          experimental results with R scripts and quickly fell in love with its
          creative problem-solving potential. That spark led me to the School of
          Code, where I&apos;m building on my scientific foundation with new
          technical skills. I also mentor young learners through JAM Coding,
          sharing my passion for tech and inspiring the next generation.
          I&apos;m excited to see where this journey takes me next!
